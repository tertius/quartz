title: "What to expect"
---

We will be a small group of likeminded people wanting to learn more about preparedness etc.

The talk will be about an hour with Q&A. There will be drinks and there may be a snack to chat afterwards. We'll probably stay another 2 hours until all talking is exhausted. We like talking.
