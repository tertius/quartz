title: "What to expect"
---

We will be a small group of likeminded people wanting to learn more about preparedness.

There will be a class for about an hour with Q&A. There will be drinks and there may be a snack to chat afterwards. We normally stay behind and chat about the topic and everything else that flows from that.
